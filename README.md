# PokeDex
Pokedex with functionality for getting local information about entered pokemon name or ID number.

Will be occasionally updated.
# Functions
Comes packaged with **1** function(s)
### `dex.pokeget(<id/name>)`
Accepts either string/int data types and can show all available info about the specified pokemon. Names are not case-sensitive, but are spell-sensitive. Run via `eval()` to verify parameter type, so may be unsecure. Use carefully.

# Local Usage
After cloning the repo, you can (in the same directory) use this file as a module in other `.py` files by using `import dex`

Required dependencies: `numpy`, `pandas`
